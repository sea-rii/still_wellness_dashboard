# Still.

*A calm space for patterns and reflection.*

Still is a wellness web app designed to help users notice emotional patterns over time — without streak pressure, judgment, or forced insights.  
It prioritizes gentleness, uncertainty, and reflection over optimization.


## ✨ Why Still?

Most wellness apps push streaks, goals, and “do better” messaging.  
Still takes a different approach:

- No streaks
- No guilt
- No diagnoses
- No pressure to “improve”

Instead, it focuses on **showing up**, **noticing patterns**, and **letting meaning emerge naturally**.

> *Patterns don’t judge — they just show up.*


## 🧠 Core Features

### 🌤 Mood Check-ins
- Daily mood logging on a **1–5 scale**
- Optional tags (e.g. sleep, stress, social)
- Designed to be quick and non-intrusive

### 📈 Dashboard
- 30-day mood average
- Days logged (presence-based, not streak-based)
- Gentle copy that normalizes steady or uneven progress
- Seeded data for realistic first-time experience

### 📊 Mood Trends
- Line chart showing mood over time
- Range normalized from **1 (very low) → 5 (very good)**
- Hoverable points to view specific days

### 📝 Journaling
- Free-form journaling with optional prompts
- No minimum length
- Journaling subtly connects to insights (without pressure)

### 💡 Insights
- Evidence-based, softly grounded reflections
- Confidence indicators (low / medium / high)
- Explicit uncertainty when data is insufficient
- “Negative space” insights when no strong patterns exist
- Micro-recommendations phrased as invitations, not advice

Examples:
- *“Based on 18 check-ins over the last 30 days”*
- *“This pattern isn’t strong yet — and that’s okay.”*

### 🔁 Regenerate Insights
- Allows users to surface alternative patterns
- Never overwrites existing data
- Reduces AI “black box” anxiety with clear explanations


## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Still is intentionally:
- Soft
- Calm
- Non-clinical
- Human

Design choices include:
- Pastel color palette
- Rounded cards and spacing
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Gentle microcopy on every page

Each page includes **one emotional anchor line**, for example:
- Dashboard: *“A steady month is still progress.”*
- Check-in: *“However today felt, it’s enough to notice it.”*
- Journal: *“You don’t need to explain yourself here.”*
- Insights: *“Patterns don’t judge — they just show up.”*


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Recharts** (for mood visualizations)
- Seeded client-side data for realistic demos

## ❤️ Final Note
Still was built to feel safe, honest, and human.

It’s not about fixing yourself.
It’s about noticing — and letting that be enough.
